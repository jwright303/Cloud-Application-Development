# Cloud-Application-Development
This class was focused on developing a restful API for a yelp-like application. The API I created connects to a mongoDB database running inside a Docker container. The database was used to keep track of individual businesses, reviews, photos, and users. I created multiple different endpoints which handeled things such as getting information about the buisniesses, modifying user reviews, and uploading and storing images on the backend. The two assignments that are included is assignment 4 and the final project. Assignment 4 contains the culmination of the yelp-like API with features such as user authentication, and offline image processing and storing. The Final-Project contains a lot of the same functionality, but for a canvas-like application and also includes rate-limiting.

## Assignment 4

### Features
Some of the features that are included in the yelp like applicaiton are:
  * Pagination for getting the list of all businesses
  * Authentication for certain actions such as editing information and deleting entries
  * Offline work using rabbitmq pipelines to create thumbnails for the images that are created through the API
