# Cloud-Application-Development
This class was focused on developing a restful API for a yelp-like application. We created multiple different endpoints which handeled things from getting information about the buisniesses, to uploading and storing images on the backend. The two assignments that are included is assignment 4 and the final project. Assignment 4 contains the culmination of the yelp-like API. The Final-Project contains a lot of the same functionality, but for a canvas like application and also includes things such as rate-limiting which was not included in Assignment 4.
